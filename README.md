This is very simplified version of Starcraft.<br >
<ul>To see how classes work, do the following:
  <li>find line 275</li>
  <li>Code snippets are shown below each comment with the word 'Part'</li>
  <li>You need to delete the " # " in every line that doesn't contain '/Comment/' and 'Part' until the next comment with 'Part'</li>
  <li>Than run programme</li>
  <li>Repeat this until the end of parts</li>
</ul>
